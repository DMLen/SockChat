# SockChat
*A basic socket messenger written in Python.*

A very basic socket-based messenger written in Python. Operates off a server-client chatroom model, where multiple clients can connect to one server and all can see messages that are posted. Supports some basic commands, the prefix for which is the hash key (#). Enter "#help" to view some commands!

In its current state, messages sent are not secured! Do not send important information via this program!
